"""
    This module contains Learner class for RePlay models training on bandit dataset.
    The format of the bandit dataset should be the same as in OpenBanditPipeline.
    Learner class has methods `fit` and `predict` which are wrappers for the corresponding
    methods of RePlay model. Optimize is based on optimization over CTR estimated by OBP.
