# How to choose a recommender

## Input Data

### _What is the input?_ 

RePlay models differ by types of data they can process:

- Collaborative use only user-item interaction logs.
- Content-based use only user or item features.
- Hybrid can use both intercations and features.

### _Are interactions explicit?_

 Our information can be either _explicit_ e.g. ratings, or _implicit_ e.g. view, number of play counts. 
\
Some models transform any type of data to implicit (_unary ratings_).

### _Will there be new users?_

Some models need to be completely retrained to give predictions for new users (not present in train data, 
but have interactions history) while others don't. 

### _Will there be new items?_

The same goes for new items.

## Model requirements

### _Should recommendations be personalized?_ 
### _Should cold users get recommendations?_ (without any interactions).
### _Should model recommend cold items?_ (that no one interacted with).
### _Should model be able to recommend unseen items?_
